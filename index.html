    <h1>Essay</h1>
    <p>This approach to finding cheats will be inconclusive because there are many reasons why 2 penguins
       could be correlated. If they are both high achieving penguins, we would expect them to be highly correlated
       because they probably both scored well on every quiz. Correlation also does not imply causation.
       Through our extra work with homework, we cans ee that it may be a little easier to spot cheating there.
       We think that this may be because homework is easier to get together and copy off of someone, while
       in a quiz it would be harder to get away with it. The diagonal on both is equal to 1 because each
       penguin's data is 100% correlated to itself. </p>
